Quick Social Login
=========

**Quick Social Login** adds integration for OAuth 2.0 service providers on your WordPress site!

Faster login or register will increase the percent of logged in users on your site, especially helpful on e-commerce sites where the checkout should be as simple as possible.

The plugin is easy to set up, each provider has detailed instructions on how to enable it.

Includes support for WooCommerce pages too!
